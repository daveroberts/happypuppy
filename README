Happy Puppy - An MVC framework for PHP
Update: Oct 26, 2010

I've been hard at work improving Happy Puppy.  Here are some of the new features:

* Support for multiple applications.  Instead of having two Happy Puppy installations for two websites, you can have one happy puppy installation for both
* An ORM.  It does the basics, but it also does some complicated things: solves the N+1 query problem, supports relations among objects
* A routing system that pre-caches all your routes

I'm still putting everything together, testing things and writing the documentation.  I'll update with some good documentation, but you can download the code now and try it out.

Happy Puppy draws its inspiration from Rails and Recess PHP.  Be sure to check those out as well.
