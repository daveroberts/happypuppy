Happy Puppy

Happy Puppy is a nano web framework for PHP. It is a fork of the Nice Dog project.

Happy Puppy lets you create pretty URLs loosely based on MVC. You create controllers with actions, and your URLs by default take the form of http://host/controller/action

So to handle the URL http://host/person/edit/Katie. You would write:

class person extends C
{
  function edit($name)
  {
    // do something here
  }
}

Easy! Of course you can also make more complex routes too.

After your controller's action has run, it will look for a template, by default in /views/person/edit.php to render the webpage.

That's the gist of it. It can do a lot more too. If you want to see it in action, you can view the samples at http://happypuppy.nfshost.com.
Quickstarts

Happy Puppy is a one file framework. You can either download HappyPuppy.php and build your system around it, or download the Samples and see Happy Puppy in use.
Quickstart with Samples

The Samples package includes examples of Happy Puppy in use and its documentation. You can either install it on your server, or see it in action at http://happypuppy.nfshost.com. The samples package contains lots of helper code which is not part of the Happy Puppy project. Any of this can be ripped out. The framework is only one file and all you really need is HappyPuppy.php. If you don't like all the filler in the Samples you can jump to the Bare Bones Quickstart below

   1. Download the Happy Puppy package at github
   2. Copy the files from the Samples directory to you webroot (/var/www/htdocs or wherever). (Note: the samples directory has a copy of HappyPuppy.php, so you can disregard the copy of HappyPuppy.php outside of the Samples directory)
   3. Point your browser at your webroot. Look at the examples and follow along in the code.

Quickstart Bare Bones - Getting started with only HappyPuppy.php

This options is for those who don't like reading directions

   1. Download the Happy Puppy package at github
   2. Copy the HappyPuppy.php file to any place on your web server
   3.

      Create a files index.php on your web server, preferebly in your webroot. Fill it with the following:

      <?php
      define('DOCROOT', getcwd().DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);
      require 'path/to/HappyPuppy.php';
      run();
      ?>

      You can optionally add other things to this file: Session Start, loading common libraries, defining routes
   4.

      Make a directory called controllers, create a file hello.php there, add the following lines:

      class hello extends C
      {
        public function world(){
          echo "Hello World";
          $this->rendered = true;
        }
      }

   5.

      If you want pretty URLs, create a file .htaccess in your webroot with the following code

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On 
  RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/public%{REQUEST_URI} -f
  RewriteRule !(^index\.php|^public/) /public%{REQUEST_URI} [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>

   6. navigate to http://host/hello/world

Why Fork?

I wanted to expand the functionality of Nice Dog. Some of the features are drawn from other frameworks. It's still a small framework, but not as small as Nice Dog is.

These are only the major features now present in Nice Dog

    * "Magic" Routes - The default route is /controller/action. You don't need to specify these in your routes file. You just create your controller with actions and you're done
    * Partials - You can render pages in pages (Yo dawg). Useful for not repeating yourself (use the same form to create or edit something)
    * Filters - Run a method before all your actions in a controller. Useful for authentication

Because it's a fork, it's been renamed
