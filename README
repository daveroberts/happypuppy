Happy Puppy

Testing 1 2 3

Happy Puppy is a nano web framework for PHP. It is a fork of the Nice Dog project.
Quickstart

   1. Download starter package
   2. Put it in your directory (/var/www/htdocs)
   3. Create a controller in the /controllers directory:

      class hello extends C
      {
        public function world(){
          echo "Hello World";
          $this->rendered = true;
        }
      }

   4. Look at the examples for more

Why Fork?

I wanted to expand the functionality of Nice Dog, but the changes are not minimalistic. Some of the features are drawn from other frameworks. It's still a small framework, but not as small as Nice Dog.
New Features

    * "Magic" Routes - The default route is /controller/action. You just create your controller with actions and you're done
    * Partials - You can render small pages into another page. Useful for things which are used on multiple pages (forms), or repeated on the same page (table rows)
    * Filters - Run a method before all your actions in a controller. Useful for authentication

Because it's a fork, it's been renamed
